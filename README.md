# Toxicity-Classifier
In this project, I have made a toxicity classifier model that accurately categorizes text as toxic or non-toxic. This model uses the TF-IDF method to extract relevant features from the text, and a Na√Øve Bayes classifier to make predictions. This model can be used in various applications such as online moderation, sentiment analysis, and much more.
